One of the most important skills for any Data Scientist is the ability to tell stories. Which sounds weird. Why would someone who works with code and data need to tell stories? Because Data Science is the process of learning valuable insights from data, and then explaining those insights to people who don't have the time or skills to look through the data themselves.

And one of the best ways to explain those insights is through visuals. What does the data look like? What are its trends? How do values different across different levels? All are questions that can easily be explained through plots.

There are many tools out there for this task, including libraries like MatPlotLib and Seaborn and entire software like Tableau.
