What is Deep Learning? Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that deals with Large Neural Networks that require huge amounts of data. In particular, Deep Learning is special in that models will continue to improve as you add more data, whereas the performance of "traditional" models will eventually plateau. Here is a nice graphic to demonstrate what I mean:
